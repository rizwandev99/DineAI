# DineAI Project Rules

1. **Context First**: At the start of every chat, you MUST read the file `.agent/context.md`.
2. **Maintenance**: If you make changes to the project structure or configuration, you MUST update `.agent/context.md`.
3. **Behavior**: This is a voice AI project. Use Python `1.3.12+` patterns for LiveKit (AgentServer, not WorkerOptions).
